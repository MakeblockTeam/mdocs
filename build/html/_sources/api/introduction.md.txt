Introduction
------------

We suggest you download and use the `mu editor <http://codewith.mu/>`_ when
working through these tutorials. Instructions for downloading and installing
Mu are on its website. You may need to install a driver, depending on your
platform (instruction are on the website).

Mu works with Windows, OSX and Linux.

Once Mu is installed connect your micro:bit to your computer via a USB lead.

Write your script in the editor window and click the "Flash" button to transfer
it to the micro:bit. If it doesn't work, make sure your micro:bit appears as
a USB storage device in your file system explorer.
